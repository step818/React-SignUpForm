# _7 Step Sign-Up Form_

#### By _**Stephen Trewick**_

## Description

This exercise was designed in React. The user is prompted to fill out a form to become a user. A user can only click the "Next" button once they've filled out all necessary inputs in a valid way. The user can always click the "Back" button to edit a form. Once a user agrees to Terms and Conditions, they're info is displayed in the web console in JSON format.
